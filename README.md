# fast-start-boilerplate
react redux express

I created this to make webpack my good friend. My goal was to make it as simple as possible. From an infinite number of settings, only the really needed ones are used.
Our ESLint helper is also here.

1. Clone this repo using:
  ```shell
  $ git clone git@github.com:ovasylenko/skillcrucial-react-redux-boilerplate.git
  ```

2. To install dependencies and clean the git repo run:

  ```shell
  $ yarn install
  ```

  *We recommend using `yarn` for installing packages, but you can use `npm` instead*:

  ```shell
  $ npm install
  ```
3. Create first build

  ```shell
  $ yarn run build:prod
  ```
